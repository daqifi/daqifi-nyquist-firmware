5 Description (continued)
Its low impedance power path optimizes switch-mode operation efficiency, reduces battery charge time and extends battery life during discharging phase. The I2C serial interface with charging and system settings makes the device a truly flexible solution.
The device supports 3.9-V to 6.2-V USB input sources, including standard USB host port and USB charging port with 6.4-V over-voltage protection. The device is compliant with USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 power specifications with input current and voltage regulation. To set the default input current limit, the BQ24296 takes the result from the detection circuit in the system, such as USB PHY device and the BQ24297 detects the input source through D+/D- detection following the USB battery charging spec 1.2. In addition, the BQ24297 detects non-standard 2-A/1-A adapters. The device also supports USB On-the-Go operation by providing fast startup and supplying adjustable voltage 4.55-V to 5.5-V (default 5 V) on the VBUS with an accurate current limit up to 1.5 A.
The power path management regulates the system slightly above battery voltage but does not drop below 3.5-V minimum system voltage (programmable). With this feature, the system keeps operating even when the battery is completely depleted or removed. When the input source current or voltage limit is reached, the power path management automatically reduces the charge current to zero and then starts discharges the battery until the system power requirement is met. This supplement mode operation keeps the input source from getting overloaded.
The device initiates and completes a charging cycle when host control is not available. It automatically charges the battery in three phases: pre-conditioning, constant current, and constant voltage. In the end, the charger automatically terminates when the charge current is below a preset limit in the constant voltage phase. Later on, when the battery voltage falls below the recharge threshold, the charger automatically starts another charging cycle.
The charge device provides various safety features for battery charging and system operation, including negative thermistor monitoring, charging safety timer, and over-voltage/over-current protections. The thermal regulation reduces charge current when the junction temperature exceeds 120°C (programmable).
The STAT output reports the charging status and any fault conditions. The INT immediately notifies the host when a fault occurs.
The BQ24296 and BQ24297 are available in a 24-pin, 4.00 x 4.00 mm2 thin VQFN package.

9.3 Feature Description
9.3.1 Device Power Up
9.3.1.1 Power-On-Reset (POR)
The internal bias circuits are powered from the higher voltage of VBUS and BAT. When VBUS or VBAT rises above UVLOZ, the sleep comparator, battery depletion comparator and BATFET driver are active. I2C interface is ready for communication and all the registers are reset to default value. The host can access all the registers after POR.
9.3.1.2 Power Up from Battery without DC Source
If only battery is present and the voltage is above depletion threshold (VBAT_DEPL), the BATFET turns on and connects battery to system. The REGN LDO stays off to minimize the quiescent current. The low RDSON in BATFET and the low quiescent current on BAT minimize the conduction loss and maximize the battery run time. During both boost and charge mode, the device always monitors the discharge current through BATFET. When the system is overloaded or shorted, the device will immediately turn off BATFET and keep BATFET off until the input source plugs in again.
9.3.1.2.1 BATFET Turn Off
The BATFET can be forced off by the host through I2C REG07[5] . This bit allows the user to independently turn off the BATFET when the battery condition becomes abnormal during charging. When BATFET is off, there is no path to charge or discharge the battery. When battery is not attached, the BATFET should be turned off by setting REG07[5] to 1 to disable charging and supplement mode.
9.3.1.2.2 Shipping Mode
To extend battery life and minimize power when system is powered off during system idle, shipping, or storage, the device can turn off BATFET so that the system voltage is zero to minimize the leakage. The BATFET can be turned off by setting REG07[5] (BATFET_DISABLE) bit.
In order to keep BATFET off during shipping mode, the host has to disable the watchdog timer (REG05[5:4] = 00) and disable BATFET (REG07[5] = 1) at the same time. Once the BATFET is disabled, one of the following events can turn on BATFET and clear REG07[5] (BATFET_DISABLE) bit.
1. Plug in adapter
2. Write REG07[5] = 0
3. watchdog timer expiration
4. Register reset (REG01[7] = 1)
5. A logic low to high transition on QON pin (refer to Figure 9-1 for detail timing)

Figure 9-1. QON Timing

When the DC source plugs in, the charger device checks the input source voltage to turn on REGN LDO and all the bias circuits. It also checks the input current limit before starts the buck converter.

9.3.1.3.1 REGN LDO
The REGN LDO supplies internal bias circuits as well as the HSFET and LSFET gate drive. The LDO also provides bias rail to TS external resistors. The pull-up rail of STAT and PG (BQ24296) can be connected to REGN as well.
The REGN is enabled when all the conditions are valid.
1. VBUS above VVBUS_UVLOZ
2. VBUS above VBAT + VSLEEPZ in buck mode or VBUS below VBAT + VSLEEP in boost mode
3. After typical 220-ms delay (100 ms minimum) is complete
If one of the above conditions is not valid, the device is in high impedance mode (HIZ) with REGN LDO off. The device draws less than IVBUS (15 µA typical) from VBUS during HIZ state. The battery powers up the system when the device is in HIZ.
9.3.1.3.2 Input Source Qualification
After REGN LDO powers up, the device checks the current capability of the input source. The input source has to meet the following requirements to start the buck converter.
1. VBUS voltage below VACOV (not in VBUS over-voltage)
2. VBUS voltage above VBADSRC (3.8 V typical) when pulling IBADSRC (30 mA typical) (poor source detection)

Once the input source passes all the conditions above, the status register REG08[2] goes high and the PG pin (BQ24296) goes low. An INT is asserted to the host.
If the device fails the poor source detection, it will repeat the detection every 2 seconds.
9.3.1.3.3 Input Current Limit Detection
The USB ports on personal computers are convenient charging source for portable devices (PDs). If the portable device is attached to a USB host, the USB specification requires the portable device to draw limited current (100 mA/500 mA in USB 2.0, and 150 mA/900 mA in USB 3.0). If the portable device is attached to a charging port, it is allowed to draw up to 3 A.

After the PG is LOW (BQ24296) or REG08[2] goes HIGH, the charger device always runs input current limit detection when a DC source plugs in unless the charger is in HIZ during host mode.
The BQ24297 follows Battery Charging Specification 1.2 (BC1.2) to detect input source through USB D+/D- lines. The BQ24296 sets input current limit through PSEL and OTG pins. After the input current limit detection is done, the detection result is reported in VBUS_STAT registers (REG08[7:6]) and input current limit is updated in IINLIM register (REG00[2:0]). In additon, host can write to REG00[2:0] to change the input current limit.
9.3.1.3.4 D+/D– Detection Sets Input Current Limit (BQ24297)
The BQ24297 contains a D+/D– based input source detection to program the input current limit. The D+/D- detection has three steps: data contact detect (DCD), primary detection, and non-standard adapter detection. When the charging source passes data contact detect, the device would proceed to run primary detection. Otherwise the charger would proceed to run non-standard adapter detection.

Figure 9-2. USB D+/D- Detection
DCD (Data Contact Detection) uses a current source to detect when the D+/D– pins have made contact during an attach event. The protocol for data contact detect is as follows:
• Detect VBUS present and REG08[2] = 1 (power good)
• Turn on D+ IDP_SRC and the D– pull-down resistor RDM_DWN for 40 ms
• If the USB connector is properly attached, the D+ line goes from HIGH to LOW, wait up to 0.5 sec.
• Turn off IDP_SRC and disconnect RDM_DWN
The primary detection is used to distinguish between USB host (Standard Down Stream Port, or SDP) and different type of charging ports (Charging Down Stream Port, or CDP, and Dedicated Charging Port, or DCP). The protocol for primary detection is as follows:
• Turn on VDP_SRC on D+ and IDM_SINK on D– for 40 ms
• If PD is attached to a USB host (SDP), the D– is low. If PD is attached to a charging port (CDP or DCP), the D– is high
• Turn off VDP_SRC and IDM_SINK
Table 9-1 shows the input current limit setting after D+/D– detection.

When DCD 0.5 sec timer expires, the non-standard adapter detection is used to distinguish three different divider bias conditions on D+/D- pins. When non-standard adapter is detected, the input current limit (REG0[2:0]) is set based on the table shown below and REG08[7:6] is set to 10 (Adapter port). If non-standard adapter is not detected, REG08[7:6] is set to 00 (Unknown) and the input current limit is set in REG0[2:0] to 500 mA by default.

After D+/D- detection is completed with an input source already plugged in, the input current limit is not changed unless DPDM_EN (REG07[7]) bit is set to force detection.
9.3.1.3.5 PSEL/OTG Pins Set Input Current Limit
The BQ24296 has PSEL instead of D+/D-. It directly takes the USB PHY device output to decide whether the input is USB host or charging port.

In battery charging spec, the good battery threshold is the minimum charge level of a battery to power up the portable device successfully. When the input source is 100-mA USB host, and the battery is above bat-good threshold (VBATGD), the device follows battery charging spec and enters high impedance state (HIZ). In HIZ state, the device is in the lowest quiescent state with REGN LDO and the bias circuits off. The charger device sets REG00[7] to 1, and the VBUS current during HIZ state will be less than 30 µA. The system is supplied by the battery.
Once the charger device enters HIZ state in host mode, it stays in HIZ until the host writes REG00[7] = 0. When the processor host wakes up, it is recommended to first check if the charger is in HIZ state.
In default mode, the charger IC will reset REG00[7] back to 0 when input source is removed. When another source plugs in, the charger IC will run detection again, and update the input current limit.
9.3.1.3.7 Force Input Current Limit Detection
While adapter is plugged-in, the host can force the charger device to run input current limit detection by setting REG07[7] = 1 or when watchdog timeout. During the forced detection, the input current limit is set to 100 mA. After the detection is completed, REG07[7] will return to 0 by itself and new input current limit is set based on D+/D- (BQ24297) or PSEL/OTG (BQ24296).
9.3.1.4 Converter Power-Up
After the input current limit is set, the converter is enabled and the HSFET and LSFET start switching. If battery charging is disabled, BATFET turns off. Otherwise, BATFET stays on to charge the battery.
The device provides soft-start when ramp up the system rail. When the system rail is below 2.2 V, the input current limit is forced to 100mA. After the system rises above 2.2 V, the charger device sets the input current limit set by the lower value between register and ILIM pin.
As a battery charger, the charger deploys a 1.5-MHz step-down switching regulator. The fixed frequency oscillator keeps tight control of the switching frequency under all conditions of input voltage, battery voltage, charge current and temperature, simplifying output filter design.

A type III compensation network allows using ceramic capacitors at the output of the converter. An internal saw-tooth ramp is compared to the internal error control signal to vary the duty cycle of the converter. The ramp height is proportional to the PMID voltage to cancel out any loop gain variation due to a change in input voltage.
In order to improve light-load efficiency, the device switches to PFM control at light load when battery is below minimum system voltage setting or charging is disabled. During the PFM operation, the switching duty cycle is set by the ratio of SYS and VBUS.
9.3.1.5 Boost Mode Operation from Battery
The device supports boost converter operation to deliver power from the battery to other portable devices through USB port. The boost mode output current rating meets the USB On-The-Go 1-A output requirement. The maximum output current is 1.5 A. The boost operation can be enabled if the following conditions are valid:
1. BAT above BATLOWV threshold (VBATLOWV set by REG04[1])
2. VBUS less than VBAT + VSLEEP (in sleep mode)
3. Boost mode operation is enabled (OTG pin HIGH and REG01[5:4] = 10)
4. Thermistor Temperature is within boost mode temperature monitor threshold unless BHOT[1:0] is set to 11 (REG06[1:0]) to disable this monitor function
5. After 30ms delay from boost mode enable
In boost mode, the device employs a 1.5-MHz step-up switching regulator. Similar to buck operation, the device switches from PWM operation to PFM operation at light load to improve efficiency.
During boost mode, the status register REG08[7:6] is set to 11, the VBUS output is 5 V and the output current can reach up to 1 A or 1.5 A, selected via I2C (REG01[0]). In addition, the device provides adjustable boost voltage from 4.55 V to 5.5 V by changing BOOSTV bits in REG06[7:4]
Any fault during boost operation, including VBUS over-voltage or over-current, sets the fault register REG09[6] to 1 and an INT is asserted.
9.3.2 Power Path Management
The device accommodates a wide range of input sources from USB, wall adapter, to car battery. The device provides automatic power path selection to supply the system (SYS) from input source (VBUS), battery (BAT), or both.
9.3.2.1 Narrow VDC Architecture
The device deploys Narrow VDC architecture (NVDC) with BATFET separating system from battery. The minimum system voltage is set by REG01[3:1]. Even with a fully depleted battery, the system is regulated above the minimum system voltage (default 3.5 V).
When the battery is below minimum system voltage setting, the BATFET operates in linear mode (LDO mode), and the system is 150 mV above the minimum system voltage setting. As the battery voltage rises above the minimum system voltage, BATFET is fully on and the voltage difference between the system and battery is the VDS of BATFET.
When the battery charging is disabled or terminated, the system is always regulated at 150 mV above the minimum system voltage setting. The status register REG08[0] goes high when the system is in minimum system voltage regulation.

9.3.2.2 Dynamic Power Management
To meet maximum current limit in USB spec and avoid over loading the adapter, the device features Dynamic Power Management (DPM), which continuously monitors the input current and input voltage.
When input source is over-loaded, either the current exceeds the input current limit (REG00[2:0]) or the voltage falls below the input voltage limit (REG00[6:3]). The device then reduces the charge current until the input current falls below the input current limit and the input voltage rises above the input voltage limit.
When the charge current is reduced to zero, but the input source is still overloaded, the system voltage starts to drop. Once the system voltage falls below the battery voltage, the device automatically enters the supplement mode where the BATFET turns on and battery starts discharging so that the system is supported from both the input source and battery.
During DPM mode (either VINDPM or IINDPM), the status register REG08[3] will go high.
Figure 9-4 shows the DPM response with 5-V/1.2-A adapter, 3.2-V battery, 2.0-A charge current and 3.4-V minimum system voltage setting.

9.3.2.3 Supplement Mode
When the system voltage falls below the battery voltage, the BATFET turns on and the BATFET gate is regulated the gate drive of BATFET so that the minimum BATFET VDS stays at 30 mV when the current is low. This prevents oscillation from entering and exiting the supplement mode. As the discharge current increases, the BATFET gate is regulated with a higher voltage to reduce RDSON until the BATFET is in full conduction. At this point onwards, the BATFET VDS linearly increases with discharge current. Figure 9-5 shows the V-I curve of the BATFET gate regulation operation. BATFET turns off to exit supplement mode when the battery is below battery depletion threshold.

9.3.3 Battery Charging Management
The device charges 1-cell Li-Ion battery with up to 3-A charge current for high capacity tablet battery. The 24-m? BATFET improves charging efficiency and minimizes the voltage drop during discharging.
9.3.3.1 Autonomous Charging Cycle
With battery charging enabled at POR (REG01[5:4] = 01), the charger device complete a charging cycle without host involvement. The device default charging parameters are listed in the following table.
Table 9-4. Charging Parameter Default Setting
DEFAULT MODEBQ24296 / BQ24297Charging voltage4.208 VCharging current2.048 APre-charge current256 mATermination current256 mATemperature profileHot/ColdSafety timer12 hours(1)(1)	See Charging Safety Timer for more information.
A new charge cycle starts when the following conditions are valid:
• Converter starts
• Battery charging is enabled by I2C register bit (REG01[5:4]) = 01 and CE is low
• No thermistor fault on TS
• No safety timer fault
• BATFET is not forced to turn off (REG07[5])
The charger device automatically terminates the charging cycle when the charging current is below termination threshold and charge voltage is above recharge threshold. When a full battery voltage is discharged below recharge threshold (REG04[0]), the device automatically starts another charging cycle. After the charge done, either toggle CE pin or REG01[5:4] will initiate a new charging cycle.

The STAT output indicates the charging status of charging (LOW), charging complete or charge disable (HIGH) or charging fault (Blinking). The status register REG08[5:4] indicates the different charging phases: 00-charging disable, 01-precharge, 10-fast charge (constant current) and constant voltage mode, 11-charging done. Once a charging cycle is complete, an INT is asserted to notify the host.
The host can always control the charging operation and optimize the charging parameters by writing to the registers through I2C.
9.3.3.2 Battery Charging Profile
The device charges the battery in three phases: preconditioning, constant current and constant voltage. At the beginning of a charging cycle, the device checks the battery voltage and applies current.

If the charger device is in DPM regulation or thermal regulation during charging, the actual charging current will be less than the programmed value. In this case, termination is temporarily disabled and the charging safety timer is counted at half the clock rate.

9.3.3.3 Thermistor Qualification


Figure 9-6. Battery Charging Profile

Expiration

The charger device provides a single thermistor input for battery temperature monitor.
9.3.3.3.1 Cold/Hot Temperature Window
The device continuously monitors battery temperature by measuring the voltage between the TS pin and ground, typically determined by a negative temperature coefficient thermistor and an external voltage divider. The device compares this voltage against its internal thresholds to determine if charge or boost is allowed.

To initiate a charge cycle, the battery temperature must be within the VLTF to VHTF thresholds. During the charge cycle the battery temperature must be within the VLTF to VTCO thresholds, else the device suspends charging and waits until the battery temperature is within the VLTF to VHTF range.
For battery protection during boost mode, the device monitors the battery temperature to be within the VBCOLDx to VBHOTx thresholds unless boost mode temperature is disabled by setting BHOT bits (REG06[3:2]) to 11. When temperature is outside of the temperature thresholds, the boost mode is suspended and REG08[7:6] bits (VBUS_STAT) are set to 00. Once temperature returns within thresholds, the boost mode is recovered.

When the TS fault occurs, the fault register REG09[2:0] indicates the actual condition on each TS pin and an INT is asserted to the host. The STAT pin indicates the fault when charging is suspended.

RT2 = 31.23 k?
9.3.3.4 Charging Termination
The device terminates a charge cycle when the battery voltage is above recharge threshold, and the current is below termination current. After the charging cycle is complete, the BATFET turns off. The converter keeps running to power the system, and BATFET can turn back on to engage supplement mode.
When termination occurs, the status register REG08[5:4] is 11, and an INT is asserted to the host. Termination is temporarily disabled if the charger device is in input current/voltage regulation or thermal regulation. Termination can be disabled by writing 0 to REG05[7].
9.3.3.4.1 Termination When REG02[0] = 1
When REG02[0] is HIGH to reduce the charging current by 80%, the charging current could be less than the termination current. The charger device termination function should be disabled. When the battery is charged to fully capacity, the host disables charging through CE pin or REG01[5:4].

9.3.3.5 Charging Safety Timer
The device has safety timer to prevent extended charging cycle due to abnormal battery conditions. The safety timer is 4 hours when the battery is below batlowv threshold. The user can program fast charge safety timer (default 12 hours) through I2C (REG05[2:1]). When safety timer expires, the fault register REG09[5:4] goes 11 and an INT is asserted to the host. The safety timer feature can be disabled via I2C (REG05[3]).
The following actions restart the safety timer after safety timer expires:

• Toggle the CE pin HIGH to LOW to HIGH (charge enable)
• Write REG01[5:4] from 00 to 01 (charge enable)
• Write REG05[3] from 0 to 1 (safety timer enable)
During input voltage/current regulation, thermal regulation, or FORCE_20PCT bit (REG02[0]) is set , the safety timer counting at half clock rate since the actual charge current is likely to be below the register setting. For example, if the charger is in input current regulation (IINDPM) throughout the whole charging cycle, and the safety time is set to 5 hours, the safety timer will expire in 10 hours. This feature can be disabled by writing 0 to REG07[6].
9.3.3.5.1 Safety Timer Configuration Change
When safety timer value needs to be changed, it is recommended that the timer is disabled first before new configuration is written to REG05[2:1]. The safety timer can be disable by writing 1 to REG05[3]. This ensures the safety timer restart counting after new value is configured.
9.3.3.6 USB Timer When Charging from USB100mA Source
The total charging time in default mode from USB100mA source is limited by a 45-min max timer. At the end of the timer, the device stops the converter and goes to HIZ.

9.3.4 Status Outputs (PG, STAT, and INT)

9.3.4.1 Power Good Indicator ( PG) (BQ24296)

In BQ24296, PG goes LOW to indicate a good input source when:
1. VBUS above VBUS_UVLO
2. VBUS above battery (not in sleep)
3. VBUS below VACOV threshold
4. VBUS above VBUS_MIN when IBADSRC current is applied (not a poor source)
9.3.4.2 Charging Status Indicator (STAT)
The device indicates charging state on the open drain STAT pin. The STAT pin can drive LED as the application diagram shows.
Table 9-6. STAT Pin State
CHARGING STATESTATCharging in progress (including recharge)LOWCharging completeHIGHSleep mode, charge disableHIGHCharge suspend (Input over-voltage, TS fault, timer fault, input or system over-voltage)blinking at 1Hz9.3.4.3 Interrupt to Host (INT)
In some applications, the host does not always monitor the charger operation. The INT notifies the system on the device operation. The following events will generate a 256-µs INT pulse.
1. USB/adapter source identified (through PSEL or DPDM detection, and OTG pin)
2. Good input source detected
• not in sleep
• VBUS below VACOV threshold
• 
• current limit above IBADSRC
3. Input removed or VBUS above VACOV threshold
4. Charge Complete
5. Any FAULT event in REG09
For the first four events, INT pulse is always generated. For the last event, when a fault occurs, the charger device sends out INT and latches the fault state in REG09 until the host reads the fault register. If a prior fault exists, the charger device would not send any INT upon new faults except NTC fault (REG09[2:0]). The NTC fault is not latched and always reports the current thermistor conditions. In order to read the current fault status, the host has to read REG09 two times consecutively. The 1st reads fault register status from the last read and the 2nd reads the current fault register status.
9.3.5 Protections
9.3.5.1 Input Current Limit on ILIM
For safe operation, the device has an additional hardware pin on ILIM to limit maximum input current on ILIM pin. The input maximum current is set by a resistor from ILIM pin to ground as:


IINMAX


? 1V RILIM


?KLIM



(2)

The actual input current limit is the lower value between ILIM setting and register setting (REG00[2:0]). For example, if the register setting is 111 for 3 A, and ILIM has a 316-? resistor to ground for 1.5 A, the input current limit is 1.5 A. ILIM pin can be used to set the input current limit rather than the register settings.
The device regulates ILIM pin at 1 V. If ILIM voltage exceeds 1 V, the device enters input current regulation (Refer to Dynamic Power Path Management section).
The voltage on ILIM pin is proportional to the input current. ILIM pin can be used to monitor the input current following Equation 3:
I	? VILIM ?I

IN	1V

INMAX

(3)

For example, if ILIM pin sets 2 A, and the ILIM voltage is 0.75 V, the actual input current 1.5 A. If ILIM pin is open, the input current is limited to zero since ILIM voltage floats above 1 V. If ILIM pin is short, the input current limit is set by the register.
9.3.5.2 Thermal Regulation and Thermal Shutdown
During charge operation, the device monitors the internal junction temperature TJ to avoid overheat the chip and limits the IC surface temperature. When the internal junction temperature exceeds the preset limit (REG06[1:0]), the device lowers down the charge current. The wide thermal regulation range from 60°C to 120°C allows the user to optimize the system thermal performance.
During thermal regulation, the actual charging current is usually below the programmed battery charging current. Therefore, termination is disabled, the safety timer runs at half the clock rate, and the status register REG08[1] goes high.
Additionally, the device has thermal shutdown to turn off the converter. The fault register REG09[5:4] is 10 and an INT is asserted to the host.
9.3.5.3 Voltage and Current Monitoring in Buck Mode
The device closely monitors the input and system voltage, as well as HSFET current for safe buck mode operation.

9.3.5.3.1 Input Over-Voltage (ACOV)
The maximum input voltage for buck mode operation is VVBUS_OP. If VBUS voltage exceeds VACOV, the device stops switching immediately. During input over voltage (ACOV), the fault register REG09[5:4] will be set to 01. An INT is asserted to the host.
9.3.5.3.2 System Over-Voltage Protection (SYSOVP)
The charger device clamps the system voltage during load transient so that the components connect to system would not be damaged due to high voltage. When SYSOVP is detected, the converter stops immediately to clamp the overshoot.
9.3.5.4 Voltage and Current Monitoring in Boost Mode
The charger device closely monitors the VBUS voltage, as well as LSFET current to ensure safe boost mode operation.
9.3.5.4.1 Over-Current Protection
The charger device closely monitors the RBFET (Q1) and LSFET (Q3) current to ensure safe boost mode operation. During over-current condition, the device will operate in hiccup mode for protection. While in hiccup mode cycle, the device turns off RBFET for tOTG_OCP_OFF (32 ms typical) and turns on RBFET for tOTG_OCP_ON (260 us typical) in an attempt to restart. If the over-current condition is removed, the boost converter will maintain the RBFET on state and the VBUS OTG output will operate normally. When over-current condition continues to exist, the device will repeat the hiccup cycle until over-current condition is removed. When over-current condition is detected, the fault register bit BOOST_FAULT (REG09[6]) is set high to indicate fault in boost operation. An INT is asserted to the host.
9.3.5.4.2 VBUS Over-Voltage Protection
When an adapter plugs in during boost mode, the VBUS voltage will rise above regulation target. Once the VBUS voltage exceeds VOTG_OVP, the device stops switching and the device exits boost mode. During the over-voltage, the fault register bit BOOST_FAULT (REG09[6]) is set high to indicate fault in boost operation. An INT is asserted to the host.
9.3.5.5 Battery Protection
9.3.5.5.1 Battery Over-Voltage Protection (BATOVP)
The battery over-voltage limit is clamped at VBAT_OVP (4% nominal) above the battery regulation voltage. When battery over voltage occurs, the charger device immediately disables charge. The fault register REG09[3] goes high and an INT is asserted to the host.
9.3.5.5.2 Battery Short Protection
If the battery voltage falls below Vshort (2V typical), the device immediately turns off BATFET to disable the battery charging or supplement mode. 1ms later, the BATFET turns on and charge the battery with 100-mA current. The device does not turn on BATFET to discharge a battery that is below 2.5 V.
9.3.5.5.3 System Over-Current Protection
If the system is shorted or exceeds the over-current limit, the device latches off BATFET. DC source insertion on VBUS is required to reset the latch-off condition and turn on BATFET.
9.4 Device Functional Modes
9.4.1 Host Mode and Default Mode
The device is a host controlled device, but it can operate in default mode without host management. In default mode, the device can be used as an autonomous charger with no host or with host in sleep.
When the charger is in default mode, REG09[7] is HIGH. When the charger is in host mode, REG09[7] is LOW. After power-on-reset, the device starts in watchdog timer expiration state, or default mode. All the registers are in the default settings. The device keeps charging the battery by default with 12-hour fast charging safety timer. At the end of the 12 hours, the charging is stopped and the buck converter continues to operate to supply system load.

Any write command to device transitions the device from default mode to host mode. All the device parameters can be programmed by the host. To keep the device in host mode, the host has to reset the watchdog timer by writing 1 to REG01[6] before the watchdog timer expires (REG05[5:4]), or disable watchdog timer by setting REG05[5:4] = 00.
When the host changes watchdog timer configuration (REG05[5:4]), it is recommended to first disable watchdog by writing 00 to REG05[5:4] and then change the watchdog to new timer values. This ensures the watchdog timer is restarted after new value is written.

Figure 9-10. Watchdog Timer Flow Chart
9.4.1.1 Plug in USB100mA Source with Good Battery
When the input source is detected as 100mA USB host, and the battery voltage is above batgood threshold (VBATGD), the charger device enters HIZ state to meet the battery charging spec requirement.
If the charger device is in host mode, it will stay in HIZ state even after the USB100mA source is removed, and the adapter plugs in. During the HIZ state, REG00[7] is set HIGH and the system load is supplied from battery. It is recommended that the processor host always checks if the charger IC is in HIZ state when it wakes up. The host can write REG00[7] to 0 to exit HIZ state.
If the charger is in default mode, when the DC source is removed, the charger device will get out of HIZ state automatically. When the input source plugs in again, the charger IC runs detection on the input source and update the input current limit.
9.4.1.2 USB Timer When Charging from USB100mA Source
The total charging time in default mode from USB100mA source is limited by a 45-min max timer. At the end of the timer, the device stops the converter and goes to HIZ.
9.5 Programming
9.5.1 Serial Interface
The device uses I2C compatible interface for flexible charging parameter programming and instantaneous device status reporting. I2C is a bi-directional 2-wire serial interface developed by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors). Only two bus lines are required: a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Devices can be considered as hosts or targets when performing data transfers. A host is the device which initiates a data transfer on the bus and generates the clock signals to permit that transfer. At that time, any device addressed is considered a target.

The device operates as a target device with address 6BH, receiving control inputs from the host device like microcontroller or a digital signal processor. The I2C interface supports both standard mode (up to 100 kbits), and fast mode (up to 400 kbits).
Both SDA and SCL are bi-directional lines, connecting to the positive supply voltage via a current source or pull-up resistor. When the bus is free, both lines are HIGH. The SDA and SCL pins are open drain.
9.5.1.1 Data Validity
The data on the SDA line must be stable during the HIGH period of the clock. The HIGH or LOW state of the data line can only change when the clock signal on the SCL line is LOW. One clock pulse is generated for each data bit transferred.



SDA





SCL


Data line stable; Data valid

Change of data allowed

Figure 9-11. Bit Transfer on the I2C Bus
9.5.1.2 START and STOP Conditions
All transactions begin with a START (S) and can be terminated by a STOP (P). A HIGH to LOW transition on the SDA line while SCl is HIGH defines a START condition. A LOW to HIGH transition on the SDA line when the SCL is HIGH defines a STOP condition.
START and STOP conditions are always generated by the host. The bus is considered busy after the START condition, and free after the STOP condition.



SDA





SCL

SCL



START (S)	STOP (P)
Figure 9-12. START and STOP Conditions
9.5.1.3 Byte Format
Every byte on the SDA line must be 8 bits long. The number of bytes to be transmitted per transfer is unrestricted. Each byte has to be followed by an Acknowledge bit. Data is transferred with the Most Significant Bit (MSB) first. If a target cannot receive or transmit another complete byte of data until it has performed some other function, it can hold the clock line SCL low to force the host into a wait state (clock stretching). Data transfer then continues when the target is ready for another byte of data and release the clock line SCL.

Figure 9-13. Data Transfer on the I2C Bus
9.5.1.4 Acknowledge (ACK) and Not Acknowledge (NACK)
The acknowledge takes place after every byte. The acknowledge bit allows the receiver to signal the transmitter that the byte was successfully received and another byte may be sent. All clock pulses, including the acknowledge 9th clock pulse, are generated by the host.
The transmitter releases the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse so the receiver can pull the SDA line LOW and it remains stable LOW during the HIGH period of this clock pulse.
When SDA remains HIGH during the 9th clock pulse, this is the Not Acknowledge signal. The host can then generate either a STOP to abort the transfer or a repeated START to start a new transfer.
9.5.1.5 Target Address and Data Direction Bit
After the START, a target address is sent. This address is 7 bits long followed by the eighth bit as a data direction bit (bit R/W). A zero indicates a transmission (WRITE) and a one indicates a request for data (READ).

Figure 9-18. Multi-Read
The fault register REG09 locks the previous fault and only clears it after the register is read. For example, if Charge Safety Timer Expiration fault occurs but recovers later, the fault register REG09 reports the fault when it is read the first time, but returns to normal when it is read the second time. To verify real time fault, the fault register REG09 should be read twice to get the real condition. In addition, the fault register REG09 does not support multi-read or multi-write.
REG09 is a fault register. It keeps all the fault information from last read until the host issues a new read. For example, if there is a TS fault but gets recovered immediately, the host still sees TS fault during the first read. In order to get the fault information at present, the host has to read REG09 for the second time. REG09 does not support multi-read and multi-write.

10 Application and Implementation

Note
Information in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, and TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for determining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design implementation to confirm system functionality.

10.1 Application Information
The BQ24296 and BQ24297 evaluation module (EVM) PWR021 is a complete charger module for evaluating the BQ24296 and BQ24297. The application curves were taken using the BQ24296/297 VM-021.

10.2.2.1 Inductor Selection
The device has 1.5-MHz switching frequency to allow the use of small inductor and capacitor values. The Inductor saturation current should be higher than the charging current (ICHG) plus half the ripple current (IRIPPLE):


ISAT ?

ICHG ?

?1/ 2? IRIPPLE


(4) ?
(1) 
The inductor ripple current depends on input voltage (VBUS), duty cycle (D = VBAT/VVBUS), switching frequency (fs) and inductance (L):



IRIPPLE

? VIN ?D ? (1? D)
?s ?L



(5) ?
(1) 
The maximum inductor ripple current happens with D = 0.5 or close to 0.5. Usually inductor ripple is designed in the range of (20 – 40%) maximum charging current as a trade-off between inductor size and efficiency for a practical design.

10.2.2.2 Input Capacitor
Input capacitor should have enough ripple current rating to absorb input switching ripple current. The worst case RMS ripple current is half of the charging current when duty cycle is 0.5. If the converter does not operate at 50% duty cycle, then the worst case capacitor RMS current ICIN occurs where the duty cycle is closest to 50% and can be estimated by the following equation:


ICIN ? ICHG ?
(6) 
?
(1) 
For best performance, VBUS should be decouple to PGND with 1-?F capacitance. The remaining input capacitor should be place on PMID.
Low ESR ceramic capacitor such as X7R or X5R is preferred for input decoupling capacitor and should be placed to the drain of the high side MOSFET and source of the low side MOSFET as close as possible. Voltage rating of the capacitor must be higher than normal input voltage level. 25-V rating or higher capacitor is preferred for 15-V input voltage. 22-?F capacitance is suggested for typical of 3-A to 4-A charging current.
10.2.2.3 Output Capacitor
Output capacitor also should have enough ripple current rating to absorb output switching ripple current. The output capacitor RMS current ICOUT is given:
I	? IRIPPLE ? 0.29 ?I

COUT	RIPPLE
(7)

The output capacitor voltage ripple can be calculated as follows:



?VO ?


VOUT

?
2 ?1?

VOUT ?


8LC?s ?

VIN ?

?	?	(8)

At certain input/output voltage and switching frequency, the voltage ripple can be reduced by increasing the output filter LC.
The charger device has internal loop compensator. To get good loop stability, the resonant frequency of the output inductor and output capacitor should be designed between 15 kHz and 36 kHz. The preferred ceramic capacitor is 6 V or higher rating, X7R or X5R.

11 Power Supply Recommendations
In order to provide an output voltage on SYS, the BQ24296/297 require a power supply between 3.9 V and
6.2 V input with at least 100-mA current rating connected to VBUS; or, a single-cell Li-Ion battery with voltage > VBATUVLO connected to BAT. The source current rating needs to be at least 3 A in order for the buck converter of the charger to provide maximum output power to SYS.

12 Layout
12.1 Layout Guidelines
The switching node rise and fall times should be minimized for minimum switching loss. Proper layout of the components to minimize high frequency current path loop (see Figure 12-1) is important to prevent electrical and magnetic field radiation and high frequency resonant problems. Here is a PCB layout priority list for proper layout. Layout PCB according to this specific order is essential.
1. Place input capacitor as close as possible to PMID pin and GND pin connections and use shortest copper trace connection or GND plane.
2. Place inductor input pin to SW pin as close as possible. Minimize the copper area of this trace to lower electrical and magnetic field radiation but make the trace wide enough to carry the charging current. Do not use multiple layers in parallel for this connection. Minimize parasitic capacitance from this area to any other trace or plane.
3. Put output capacitor near to the inductor and the IC. Ground connections need to be tied to the IC ground with a short copper trace connection or GND plane.
4. Route analog ground separately from power ground. Connect analog ground and connect power ground separately. Connect analog ground and power ground together using thermal pad as the single ground connection point. Or using a 0? resistor to tie analog ground to power ground.
5. Use single ground connection to tie charger power ground to charger analog ground. Just beneath the IC. Use ground copper pour but avoid power pins to reduce inductive and capacitive noise coupling.
6. Decoupling capacitors should be placed next to the IC pins and make trace connection as short as possible.
7. It is critical that the exposed thermal pad on the backside of the IC package be soldered to the PCB ground. Ensure that there are sufficient thermal vias directly under the IC, connecting to the ground plane on the other layers.
8. The via size and number should be enough for a given current path.
See the EVM design for the recommended component placement with trace and via locations. For the VQFN information, refer to Quad Flatpack No-Lead Logic Packages Application Report and QFN and SON PCB Attachment Application Report.
