# Host unit tests (`tests/host/`)

PC-based (`gcc`) unit tests for self-contained firmware utility modules. No
hardware, no MPLAB X, no RTOS — compile and run in seconds. Issue #124.

## Run

```bash
cd tests/host
make run
```

`make run` builds and runs the suite; the process exit code is non-zero if any
test fails, so it drops straight into CI. `make clean` removes build artifacts.

## What's covered

`test_circularbuffer.c` exercises `firmware/src/Util/CircularBuffer.c`:

- init / `AddBytes` / `NumBytesAvailable` / `NumBytesFree` accounting
- exact-full fill and all-or-nothing add rejection
- physical wrap-around (copy-mode stitches both chunks; callback-mode
  deliberately hands only the pre-wrap chunk — see the comment in
  `CircularBuf_ProcessBytes`)
- `ProcessBytes` callback semantics (#126): ring advances by the callback's
  returned count only, clamped to the bytes offered; a negative return
  consumes nothing and propagates the error
- `Reset`, `InitExternal` (borrowed buffer, not freed on deinit), `Resize`
  (grow owned, same-size no-op, zero rejected, external rejected)
- SPSC counter wraparound near `UINT32_MAX` — both the pure
  `produced - consumed` math and a round-trip through the real
  `AddBytes` / `ProcessBytes` API across the 2^32 boundary
- NULL-argument safety on every entry point

## Framework

`test_framework.h` is a ~90-line header-only harness — `TEST()` to define a
case, `RUN()` to execute it, `ASSERT_TRUE` / `ASSERT_EQ` / `ASSERT_BYTES`, and
`TEST_SUMMARY()` for the exit code. No Unity / CMocka / network downloads (the
build station may be offline).

## Stubs & the build-time source copy

`CircularBuffer.c` has two firmware includes that don't exist on the host:

- `osal/osal.h` → `stubs/osal/osal.h` maps `OSAL_Malloc`/`OSAL_Free` onto libc
  `malloc`/`free`, so the allocator paths run for real.
- `Logger.h` → `stubs/Logger.h` makes `LOG_E` a no-op (the real header pulls in
  FreeRTOS + libscpi).

Both are **quoted** includes, which GCC resolves relative to the *source file's
own directory* first — so a stub on the include path can't shadow the real
`Logger.h` sitting next to `CircularBuffer.c`. The Makefile therefore copies the
source to `CircularBuffer_uut.c` in this directory before compiling; from here
the quoted includes fall through to `-Istubs` and `-I../../firmware/src/Util`
(the real `CircularBuffer.h`). The copy is regenerated on every build, so it
always tracks the real source — edit `CircularBuffer.c` and re-run `make run`.

## Adding another module

1. Drop `test_<module>.c` here with its own `main()` (or extend the Makefile to
   build multiple binaries).
2. Add thin stubs under `stubs/` for any firmware headers the module pulls in.
3. If the module uses quoted firmware includes, follow the build-time-copy
   pattern above so the stubs win.
