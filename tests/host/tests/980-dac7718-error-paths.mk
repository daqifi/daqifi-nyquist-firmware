# MIGRATED FROM tests/host/Makefile BY #1026's MERGE, unchanged in effect.
# main added this target to the monolithic file (PR #990) while this branch was
# splitting that file into fragments, so the two collided. The comment block,
# both source variables and all ten grep guards below are main's text verbatim;
# what is added is the two accumulator lines this directory's convention needs.
# That is the whole migration for an incoming target, and it is the argument for
# the split: had #990 landed as a fragment there would have been no conflict.

# #980: DAC7718 error-path honesty (lock ownership in DAC7718_ReadWriteReg,
# init-failure propagation + slot retention in DAC_EnsureHardwareInitialized).
# Like BENCH_BIN, neither DAC7718.c (Harmony GPIO/SPI/coretimer + FreeRTOS
# semaphores) nor SCPIDAC.c (+ libscpi + BoardData/BoardConfig) is includable
# on the host, so the test re-implements both control-flow SHAPES against
# mocks. The grep guards pin the two shape-defining identifiers and the
# one-slot allocator constant the mock's fidelity claim depends on; a rename,
# removal, or a MAX_DAC7718_CONFIG bump above 1 invalidates the test's premise
# and must fail loudly rather than silently pass a stale copy.
#
# Part D (added post-merge, PR #990's own pre-merge adversarial audit, BLOCK
# verdict): SCPI_DACVoltageGet's dacWriterPossible gate, fixing the confirmed
# regression where the getter's new command-serialization lock was taken
# UNCONDITIONALLY even though the mutex it locks is created only under
# BoardVariant == 3 -- failing every SOUR:VOLT:LEV? with "DAC command busy"
# on NQ1/NQ2 (every board on this bench) where the pre-PR getter always
# succeeded. Two more grep guards below pin the predicate and the
# lockHeld-threaded Unlock call.
